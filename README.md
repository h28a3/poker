## rules
1. Each player puts one chip on the field as a participation chip.
2. The parent deals out the well-cut cards, one face down from the person to the left, so that there are five cards in each hand. The remainder are considered stock.
3. Looking at the cards dealt, the players declare "bid" or "pass" in turn, starting with the person to the left of the parent. Once one person bids, no one after that can pass. The first person to bid says how many chips he or she has and puts them on the table.(It is advisable to decide on the maximum number of chips.)
4. The next person to call, raise or drop proceeds with the game. The person who raises must say how many chips he or she has.
5. After one round against the best bid, without anyone raising, the first bid is over.
6. If there are three or more players remaining in the game, the player nearest to the left of the parent exchanges hands and draws.
7. To create a stronger hand, the player puts unwanted cards in his or her hand face down on the table and receives from the parent the number of cards he or she has discarded. The parent replaces the cards himself, but tells you how many cards he has replaced. Each player then examines his or her new hand.
8. When there are no more stock cards, the discarded cards are collected, shuffled well, and used.
9. Once the draw is done, it is time to bid a second time. The new hand is examined, and the first bidder declares "bid" or "check". At this time, once one player has bid, the subsequent players cannot check.
10. Then, as before, the game proceeds with a call-raise-drop.
11. The auction ends when one round has passed without anyone raising against the best bid. The hands are revealed and compared with the other players. The player with the strongest poker hand wins all the chips on the table.
12. The same is also true if all other players have made a drop.
13. The game continues in this manner for several rounds, and eventually the players with the most chips are placed first, second, and third ..., in that order.
